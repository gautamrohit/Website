National Institute of Technology, Srinagar is the only technical institute of national importance in the state of Jammu & Kashmir and is one of the premier technical institutes of India. The institute was one of the first eight Regional Engineering Colleges, established in 1960, by the Government of India. In 2003,the institute was converted to National Institute of Technology by the Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Government of India, as an institute of National Importance.
We have been imparting quality education since the inception of the institute by focusing on technical advancements and research. The institute offers B.Tech courses in eight different disciplines. Besides B.Tech courses, the institute offers M.Tech programmes in Civil Engineering, Elecrtonics & Communication Engineering and Mechanical Engineering and Ph.D programmes in all departments. The students are admitted on the basis of JEE, DASA and GATE every year. Our faculty members are actively participating in National and International Conferences and Seminars, workshops and other related research activities.
It gives me immense pleasure to mention that NIT Srinagar has been awarded "OUTSTANDING ENGINEERING INSTITUTE (NORTH)" by DAINIK BHASKAR in 2013 and "OUTSTANDING ENGINEERING INSTITUTE (NORTH)" by ABP NEWS in 2014. Department of Training and Placement at NIT Srinagar plays a key role in finding a safe and secure future for our students and also provides an opportunity for them to choose their career in areas of their interest. Various national and multinational companies, reputed public sector undertaking, etc. regularly visit our institute for campus recruitment. Many of our students are currently heading various leading organizations and shouldering vital responsibilities in both India and abroad. The institute maintains very good relationship with the recruiters and all possible hospitality is extended to them. I am quite sure that students of our institute will prove themselves capable enough to meet the challenges of modern technical world.
I wish them all the best for their future.
